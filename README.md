# Network-Based-Airline-Route-Analysis
This study uses graph theory to analyze an airline dataset with airport, route, and operator info. Airports are nodes, routes are weighted edges. After data cleaning, shortest paths and centrality measures identified key hubs. Insights support route optimization, efficiency, and better airline decision-making.
